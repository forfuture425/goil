            <h3>Summary of Terms</h3>
            <p><strong>Below is a summary of important items relating to these Terms and the GOIL Contract. This summary is provided for convenience only and does not replace, detract from or limit the full text of the Terms or your obligation read the entire text thoroughly.</strong>
           
                <ul>
                    <li>The Site and Interface through which you are accessing the GOIL Contract is simply an interface to the GOIL Contract. It does not control the GOIL Contract, and the registered owner of the Site did not create the GOIL Contract.</li>
                    <li>The Site is not a recommendation to participate in the GOIL Contract. You are responsible for collecting all relevant information and for your decision whether to participate in the GOIL Contract.</li>
                    <li>The creators of the GOIL Contract will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the GOIL Coin. All proceeds from the sale of the GOIL Coin will be used solely as directed by the governance mechanism of the GOIL Coin.</li>
                    <li>The GOIL Contract is provided at your sole risk. Use at your own caution.</li>
                    <li>The software code underlying the GOIL Contract is open source and you are encouraged to check it thoroughly to ensure it meets your needs before interacting with it or depositing any funds within it.</li>
                    <li>The GOIL Contract is programmed to sell GOIL Coins at different prices. There is no commitment that coins will not be sold at a price that is lower or higher than the price that you paid.</li>
                    <li>Once the GOIL Coins are generated by the GOIL Contract, the GOIL Contract will be controlled by the governance mechanism of the GOIL Coins. No guarantees or commitments may be made currently regarding the decisions that the governance mechanism may make regarding the GOIL Contract and the use of the funds deposited in the GOIL Contract.</li>
                    <li>All GOIL Coin generation and allocation are made by the GOIL Contract in an autonomous and automatic manner. Therefore, no claims or changes may be made regarding any GOIL Coin generation or allocation, as they cannot be changed.</li>
                    <li>There are no refunds.</li>
                    <li>Since neither the creators of the GOIL Contract nor the registered owners of the Site receive any proceeds, they will have no liability for any matter relating to the GOIL Contract or the GOIL Coins.</li>
                    <li>The GOIL Coin has no functionality or utility, and no inherent value. Its sole purpose is to raise awareness for Israel.</li>
                    <li>Purchasing cryptocurrencies entails many risks. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with those risks and to take them into account before depositing any funds into the GOIL Contract.</li>
                    <li>You may lose the entire amount of the funds that you deposit into the GOIL Contract. Therefore, only deposit funds that you feel comfortable losing.</li>
                    <li>You represent and warrant that you are not a citizen or resident or located in any country or territory subject to United States, European Union, United Kingdom, or Israeli sanctions or trade restrictions.</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <h3>Governance</h3>
            <p>Control over the GOIL Contract will be decided by the decentralized governance mechanism of the GOIL Coins. Such governance mechanism may make changes to the GOIL Contract from time to time, with or without notice, in its sole discretion. You are responsible for monitoring any communications or announcements regarding such changes, updates or upgrades, and ensuring that any continued use of the GOIL Contract meets your needs and requirements.</p>

            <h3>Decentralized Organization</h3>
            <p>By purchasing GOIL Coins, you will become a participant in a decentralized organization or decentralized autonomous organization, commonly referred to as a “DAO”. It is your sole responsibility to familiarize yourself with the implications of holding a cryptocurrency that is part of a DAO.</p>

            <h3>Risk Disclosures Relating to Blockchain</h3>
            <p>By utilizing the Interface and interacting with the GOIL Contract, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, digital wallets, blockchains and other distributed and decentralized systems, and smart contracts. In particular, you are aware and recognize that any transactions conducted on a blockchain cannot be undone or reversed.</p>

            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>The Site may contain information regarding the GOIL Contract or particular instances of the GOIL Contract. Such information is provided for informational purpose only, without any representation or warranty. The owners of the Site do not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such information. Before acting upon or making any decisions on the basis of such information, you are responsible to independently verify such information.</p>

            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <p>The software code underlying the GOIL Contract is open source. Therefore, all information regarding the operation, logic and functioning of the GOIL Contract is publicly available. Before interacting with the GOIL Contract or depositing any funds within the GOIL Contract, it is your sole responsibility to conduct such checks regarding such software code as you deem appropriate, in order to understand its functionality and manner of operation. Since all such information is publicly available and your obligation to ascertain, no other party, including the creators of the GOIL Contract and the registered owners of the Site, have any responsibility or liability towards you or regarding the consequences of your use of, and interaction with, the GOIL Contract.</p>

            <h3>No Interest</h3>
            <p>The funds that you deposit in the GOIL Contract will not bear interest.</p>

            <h3>Use of Treasury Funds</h3>
            <p>The governance mechanism of the GOIL Coins will determine the use of the treasury funds of the GOIL Contract. Therefore, there can be no assurance or guaranty that the funds will be used for the purposes stated on the Site. The governance mechanism may make any decision that the GOIL Coin holders determine.</p>

            <h3>Hacking; Loss of Funds</h3>
            <p>Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise, or secure cryptocurrencies, such as by attacking the GOIL Contract, applicable blockchain network source code, exchange servers, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or cryptocurrencies transaction history, or by other means. The GOIL Contract may become an appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. The foregoing may result in the loss or stealing of all or part of the cryptocurrencies deposited in the GOIL Contract treasury. Any such loss will be irretrievable and may materially and adversely impact the ability of the GOIL Contract to fulfill its intended purpose.</p>

            <h3>No Responsibility for Any Loss</h3>
            <p>The GOIL Contract and blockchain networks are decentralized open source systems and may still under active development, and therefore: (a) may contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or corruption of cryptocurrencies deposited within them and/or data, (d) may be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent versions, all with or without notice to you, or (e) may have security vulnerabilities and be subject to hacking. Neither the creators of the GOIL Contract nor the registered owners of the Site will be liable or responsible for any losses or damages to you, including without limitation any loss of funds deposited in the GOIL Contract, as a result of any of the foregoing.</p>
